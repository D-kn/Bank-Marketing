## 1. Description 
It was an academic Data mining project about BANK MARKETING. In this work, we Built an automatic model using Deep Learning to predict whether or not the client will take a long term deposit.
## 2. Tools and technics used
### Unsupervised Learning
HAC, PCA, K-means
### Supervised Learning
KNN, Linear SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, ANNs, Cross-validation, Features engineering
## 3. Method used to predict
We comprare accuracies of all models used and found out that with ANNs, we had better results than others and our model was able to generalize under other datas.
