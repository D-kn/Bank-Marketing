## 1. Description 
It was a Data mining project about BANK MARKETING. In this work, we Built an automatic model using Deep Learning to predict whether or not the client will subscribe to long term deposit.
## 2. Tools and technics used
### Supervised Learning
KNN, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, ANNs, Cross-validation, Features engineering
## 3. Method used to predict
We comprare accuracies of all models used and found out that with ANNs, we had better results than others and our model was able to generalize under other datas.
