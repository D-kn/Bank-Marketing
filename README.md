<h2> 1. Description </h2> 
It was a Data mining project about BANK MARKETING. In this work, we Built an automatic model using Deep Learning to predict whether or not the client will subscribe to long term deposit.
<h2> 2. Tools and techniques used </h2>
<h3> Supervised Learning </h3>
KNN, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, ANNs, Cross-validation, Features engineering
<h2> 3. Method used to predict</h2>
We comprare accuracies of all models used and found out that with ANNs, we had better results than others and our model was able to generalize under other datas.
